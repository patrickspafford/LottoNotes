# LottoNotes

## Description
An iOS app for note-taking that helps users randomly review old notes. By (sometimes) showing a random note when the app is opened, the app encourages active maintenance of older notes and the forging of new connections between the seemingly unrelated ideas between an old note and the one that you opened the app to write.

## Features
- When a random note is opened (that is, you "win the lottery"), users must at the least scroll down to the bottom of the note before they can declare that they have read it.
- Easily create simple no-nonsense notes
- Notes are randomized after the creation or edit of a note
- Users can conveniently edit old notes when they "win the lottery"
- Delete notes with a swipe
- Refined dark theme
